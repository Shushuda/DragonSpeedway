# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DragonSpeedway is a World of Warcraft addon that plays custom music and sound effects during Dragon Riding races. It's split into two addons:
- **DragonSpeedway** - Core logic, settings UI, race detection
- **DragonSpeedway_Music** - Music/sound file storage and LibSharedMedia registration (kept separate to prevent addon managers from overwriting user-added music files)

## Development & Testing

There is no build system - this is direct Lua scripting for WoW.

**Testing changes:**
1. Copy `DragonSpeedway/` and `DragonSpeedway_Music/` to `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/`
2. **Full game restart required** for new music files (not just `/reload`)
3. Test in-game via `/ds` (opens settings) or `/ds stop` (stops music)

**Adding custom music (Windows):**
```bash
cd DragonSpeedway_Music
mv registerFiles.bat.txt registerFiles.bat
./registerFiles.bat  # Generates DragonSpeedway-AutoGenerated.lua
```

**Race ID formatting utility:**
```bash
# Reads IDs.txt (comma-separated), outputs result.txt (Lua table format)
python DragonSpeedway-ID-generator.py
```

## Architecture

### Key Files
- `DragonSpeedway/DragonSpeedway.lua` - Core addon: race detection, music playback, camera control
- `DragonSpeedway/DragonSpeedway-Options.lua` - Settings panel UI
- `DragonSpeedway_Music/DragonSpeedway-LSM.lua` - Spyro music registration (predefined filenames)
- `DragonSpeedway_Music/DragonSpeedway-CustomMusic.lua` - Custom music registration template
- `DragonSpeedway_Music/DragonSpeedway-AutoGenerated.lua` - Auto-generated from .bat script

### Libraries (in `Libs/`)
- **LibSharedMedia-3.0** - Sound file registration and retrieval
- **MC2SchedulerLib** - Task scheduling/timers
- **LibStub** + **CallbackHandler-1.0** - Library loading and events

### Event-Driven Architecture
The addon monitors WoW events:
- `UNIT_AURA` - Detects race start/end via spell auras
- `LOADING_SCREEN_DISABLED` - Handles mount state on zone changes
- `ADDON_LOADED` - Initialization

### Race Detection
- Large lookup tables of spell IDs for races (~100+ entries) and dragon riding mounts (~40+ entries)
- Separate countdown spell ID detection
- Instance IDs tracked to properly clean up aura monitoring

### State Management
- Saves/restores global music and volume settings around races
- Mount state reconciliation prevents state desync after zone loads
- SavedVariables: `DragonSpeedwayDB` (per-character settings)

### Music System
- Three music groups: Spyro1, Spyro2, Spyro3, Custom
- Music tables dynamically built from LSM registry at startup
- Random selection from user-configured groups (All/Spyro/Custom)
- Validation via `LSM:IsValid()` on load

## File Formats

**Sound files:** `.mp3` or `.ogg` only

**LSM registration format:**
```lua
LSM:Register("sound", "Display Name", [[Interface\Addons\DragonSpeedway_Music\Music\Custom\filename.mp3]])
```

**Spyro music filenames are fixed** (see DragonSpeedway-LSM.lua or README.md for exact names).

## WoW Interface Version

Currently targets retail WoW (Interface version in .toc files). Update TOC `## Interface:` value when WoW patches break compatibility.
